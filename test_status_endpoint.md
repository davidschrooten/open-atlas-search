# Testing the Status Endpoint

## Overview
We've successfully added a comprehensive status endpoint to the Open Atlas Search service that provides detailed information about each index, including the `lastSync` timestamp.

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced IndexInfo Structure
- Added `LastSync *time.Time` field to track when each index was last synchronized
- The field is optional (`omitempty`) and uses a pointer to handle cases where sync hasn't occurred yet

### 2. Search Engine Enhancements
- Added `lastSync` map to track sync times for each index
- Added `syncMutex` for thread-safe access to sync times
- Added `UpdateLastSync()` method to update sync times
- Enhanced `ListIndexes()` to include sync information
- Added cleanup of sync tracking when indexes are removed

### 3. Indexer Service Updates
- Modified to call `UpdateLastSync()` after initial indexing completes
- Modified to call `UpdateLastSync()` after each polling cycle (even if no new documents)
- This ensures the `lastSync` timestamp reflects the last time the index was checked, not just when new documents were found

### 4. New API Endpoint
- Added `GET /status` endpoint that provides comprehensive service status
- Returns detailed information about all indexes including sync times
- Includes summary statistics (total indexes, total documents)

## API Response Format

### GET /status
```json
{
  "service": "open-atlas-search",
  "status": "running",
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "mydb.users.search_index",
      "docCount": 1500,
      "status": "active",
      "lastSync": "2025-07-31T18:57:24Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "mydb.orders.search_index", 
      "docCount": 3200,
      "status": "active",
      "lastSync": "2025-07-31T18:56:15Z"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalIndexes": 2,
    "totalDocuments": 4700
  }
}
```

### GET /indexes (also enhanced)
```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "mydb.users.search_index",
      "docCount": 1500,
      "status": "active",
      "lastSync": "2025-07-31T18:57:24Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the service** with your configuration
2. **Wait for initial indexing** to complete - you should see logs like:
   ```
   Initial indexing completed for mydb.users: 1500 documents indexed
   ```
3. **Call the status endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/status | jq
   ```
4. **Verify lastSync times** are present and recent
5. **Wait for a polling cycle** (default 5 seconds) and call status again
6. **Confirm lastSync times are updated** even if no new documents were indexed

## Key Features

- **Real-time sync tracking**: Shows when each index was last synchronized
- **Thread-safe**: Uses separate mutex for sync time tracking to avoid lock contention
- **Comprehensive status**: Single endpoint to monitor all indexes and their health
- **Backwards compatible**: Existing `/indexes` endpoint enhanced but maintains compatibility
- **Clean resource management**: Sync tracking is properly cleaned up when indexes are removed

## Use Cases

- **Monitoring dashboards**: Display sync status of all indexes
- **Health checks**: Verify indexes are being regularly updated
- **Debugging**: Identify indexes that may have stopped syncing
- **Operations**: Get overview of search service health and activity
